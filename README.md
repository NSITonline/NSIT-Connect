NSIT Connect is the official NSITOnline app that aims to act as a companion app for the students of NSIT. The app contains several useful modules that enable students to stay up-to-date with all the college news, maintain a schedule according to their timetable, find out all about interesting places in and around college, and more.

But this project is a lot more than an app. This is an initiative that is targetted at all the emerging developers of NSIT and encourages them to take part in this as a collaborative open-source team effort. So if you are an NSITian and you love developing things and wish to see them used by a large number of people, you have come to the right place.

### 3.Video
[Junoon Photography Club's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu445B5LTXzkNr5eft8wNHg) is the source of all entertainment going on in the college. No one wants to miss out on them, so this section gets you the latest uploads and also allows you to view them right there in the app.

### 4.Calendar
The Calendar helps you in tracking your attendance on a regular basis by recording your dates attended and missed (input by the user). It can also fetch your timetable from our server and give you advice about how many classes you need to attend to make up for short attendance or how many you can miss if you have more than enough attendance.

### 5.Locations
Locations help you to get around the whole college by providing you with all hotspots that NSITians frequent. You can think of it as a Bible of all the places in NSIT and not only that, you can visit that location in a map and also check how far you are and how much time it will take you to reach there.
