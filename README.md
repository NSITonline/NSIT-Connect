# NSIT App V2
NSIT App V2 is the official NSITonline app that aims to act as a companion app for NSIT students. The app contains several useful modules like staying up-to-date with all the college news, maintaining a schedule according to the timetable, all the information related to interesting places of the college, and more.

But this project is a lot more than an app. This is an initiative that is targetted at all the emerging developers of NSIT and encourages them to take part in this as a collaborative open-source team effort. So if you are an NSITiian and you love developing things and wish to see them used by a large number of people, you have come to the right place.
